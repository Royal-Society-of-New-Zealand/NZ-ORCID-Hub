    <h2 class="display-2">Welcome To The NZ ORCID Hub</h2>
    <p>The New Zealand ORCID Hub will allow all Consortium members to productively engage with ORCID irregardless of technical resources. The technology partner, with oversight from the IT Advisory Group, lead agency and ORCID, will develop and maintain the Hub.</p>
    <p>Work undertaken as part of the MBIE-led ORCID Working Group confirmed the view that New Zealand's research organisations exist in a wide range of sizes and ability to access IT support. As a consequence, the ability of organisations to respond to the ORCID Joint Statement of Principle that New Zealand adopt ORCID as the national researcher identifier also varied widely. In recognition that assisting all Consortia-eligible organisations to productively engage with ORCID would lead to national benefits, the Ministry has provided support for the development of the New Zealand ORCID Hub. As designed, the core function of the Hub is to provide all New Zealand ORCID Consortium members with the ability to make authoritative assertions of their relationship with researchers on the researcher's ORCID record, irrespective of their size or technical resource.</p>
    <p>Throughout 2017 to June 2018, this project is being developed by a team at the University of Auckland under contract to the Royal Society of New Zealand as product owner, and with guidance from ORCID.  As the phenomena of small research organisations is not limited to New Zealand, it is a principle of the Hub's development is that it be architected for use by the global ORCID community.  To support this design principle, development is being pursued in as transparent a nature as possible, with the Hub itself being developed under the permissive MIT License.</p>
    <p>The core development team at the University of Auckland consists of: jeff kennedy, Enterprise Architecture Manager; Radomirs Cirskis, ORCID Project Architect; and Roshan Pawar, ORCID Developer.</p>
